Olist E-Commerce Sales and Customer Insights Analysis


Objective:

To analyze sales performance, customer behavior, and shipping logistics of the Brazilian
marketplace, Olist. This project aims to generate insights for optimizing sales strategies, improving
customer retention, and streamlining logistics through data analysis using Python, MySQL, andÂ Tableau.


1. Data Cleaning (Python):
- Handle Missing Values: Identify and fill missing CustomerID, Order Delivered Time, and Payment Value fields.
- Convert Dates: Convert Order Purchase Timestamp and Order Delivered Time into datetime format.
- Standardize Product Categories: Clean and standardize product categories for consistent analysis.
- Remove Duplicates: Identify and remove duplicate records in the dataset.
- Geographical Data Standardization: Standardize Customer State and other geographic fields.
- Create New Features: Generate features such as Order Processing Time (difference between purchase and delivery dates).
- Descriptive Statistics: Generate summary statistics for Sales, Freight, and Customer Segments.
- Aggregate Sales by Time: Use Python to calculate total sales per day, month, and quarter.
- Export Cleaned Data: Export the cleaned dataset to a format suitable for MySQL insertion.


2. SQL Querying (MySQL):
-- Create Database Schema
-- How do you set up tables for Orders, Customers, Products, and Shipping in MySQL?
-- How do you load cleaned data into the Orders, Customers, Products, and Shipping tables?
-- How many orders were placed for each product category?
-- How many customers are there in each state?
-- What is the total sales value for each state?
-- What is the total shipping time for each state?
-- How many delayed orders are there in each state?
-- How many orders were placed in each region (state)?
-- What is the total revenue generated by each product category?
-- What is the average order value for each customer?


3. Data Visualization (Tableau):
- Sales Trends Dashboard: Visualize sales trends over time (daily, monthly, quarterly) using line charts.
- Geographical Sales Map: Create a geographical heatmap showing sales by Customer State.
- Customer Segmentation Dashboard: Display customer segments based on spending and purchase frequency.
- Top Products Dashboard: Visualize the top-performing products by category and region using bar charts.
- Shipping Performance Heatmap: Create a heatmap showing average delivery times and delays by region.
- Product Review Scores: Visualize customer review scores by product category.
- Freight Cost vs. Revenue: Create a scatter plot to analyze the relationship between freight costs and total revenue.
- Delayed Orders Dashboard: Show the percentage of delayed orders by region and product category.
- Payment Method Insights: Visualize the distribution of payment methods and their impact on total revenue.
- Order Value Distribution: Use a histogram to show the distribution of order values across different customer segments.



Project Scope:

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Python):
- Handle missing and null values in customer, product, and transaction data.
- Standardize product categories, shipping statuses, and customer geographic details
(country/state).
- Perform descriptive statistics to get an overview of sales, customer distribution, and product
performance.

2. Data Storage & Querying (MySQL):
- Set up a MySQL database schema to store cleaned data, including tables for transactions, customers, products, payments, and shipping.
- Write SQL queries to analyze the following areas:
-Table Setup (Create Database Schema)
-Data Insertion (Loading Cleaned Data)
-Sales Analysis, Customer Segmentation, Geographical Sales, Shipping Performance, Delayed Orders, Product Revenue, Customer Insights


3. Data Visualization (Tableau):
- Create interactive dashboards with geographical insights, including:
- Sales trends by country and region.
- Customer segmentation based on spending, purchase frequency, and geographical location.
- Shipping performance visualized geographically, showing delays and average shipping times by state and country.
