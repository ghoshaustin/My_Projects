Project Requirement Document
Project Name: Retail_Sales_Insights
Objective:
The Retail_Sales_Insights project focuses on utilizing data cleaning, transformation, and analysis techniques on the Retail Sales Dataset. The project will use Python for data cleaning and preprocessing, MySQL for querying and data analysis, and Tableau for visualizing business insights. The goal is to prepare a comprehensive solution that addresses common data quality issues and generates actionable insights for decision-making.

Project Scope:
The project will include tasks such as identifying and handling missing values, cleaning unnecessary characters, removing duplicates, transforming data types, and creating meaningful insights through analysis and visualization. The project will be divided into three main components: Python for data cleaning, MySQL for querying, and Tableau for visualizing the data.

Python Tasks (Data Cleaning & Preprocessing):

Check for Missing Values:
Identify and list columns with missing data, calculating the total count of missing entries.

Fill Missing Values:
Impute missing numerical values using the median and fill missing categorical data.

Handle Duplicates:
Detect and remove duplicate records in the dataset to maintain data integrity.

Correct Data Types:
Ensure data types are appropriately formatted (e.g., convert Date columns to datetime, Total_Amount to float).

Clean String And Numerical Data:
Remove unnecessary spaces, special characters, and correct irregularities in fields like customer names and addresses

Analysis:
# 1. Analyze the Total Sales per State (using pandas).

# 2. Visualize Total Sales by State (using seaborn).

# 3. Visualize the Breakdown of Customer Segments.

# 4. Plot the Purchase Trends Over Time (using matplotlib).

# 5. Find Customers with Total Amount Above a Certain Threshold.

# 6. Find the Average Purchase Amount by Customer Segment.

# 7. Sort the data by Total_Amount in descending order.

# 8. Use iloc to select rows 10 to 15 and specific columns.

# 9. Group by Product_Brand and calculate total purchases for each brand.

# 10. Rename columns 'Total_Amount' to 'Total_Spent' and 'Total_Purchases' to 'Purchases_Made'.

# 11. Use iloc to select the 3rd, 7th, and 10th rows and specific columns.

# 12. Group by Gender and count the number of unique customers.

# 13. Group by 'State' and calculate max and min of Total_Amount for each state.

# 14. Data Export for MySQL: After cleaning, export the prepared data in a CSV format for integration with MySQL.

# 15. Connect Python to MySQL using mysql.connector.

# 16. Create a MySQL table from the cleaned data.

# 17. Insert data from the CSV into MySQL in batches.

# 18. Write a query in Python to retrieve records from MySQL.

# 19. Update records in MySQL based on data from the cleaned dataset.

# 20. Verify the successful insertion of data into MySQL with a SELECT query in Python.
